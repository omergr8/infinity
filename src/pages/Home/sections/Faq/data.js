    heading: "HOW DOES IT WORK?",
    text: "Instead of picking tokens or BNBs from transactions like Safemoon Shield or HODL do, IFNINITY charges a fee which it instead places in BNB pool and CAKE staking. The profit staking generates is sent out to the holders.",
    text2:
      "This means that INFINITY also protects holders from the risk of a death spiral, which Shield, hodl  and similar Tokens end up in, reduced reward and even more people selling. Since the INFINITY reward will always increase, the holders will not harmed by someone selling, but only create more space for BNB pool and CAKE staking station.",

If you want to also benefit from CAKE reward distribution you will have to hold at least 1.000.000 $Infinity tokens.",
